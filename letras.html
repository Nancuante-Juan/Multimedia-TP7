            Oh, villains ain't but a thing (ain't but a thing)  <br>
            Blink of an eye, I'll show them why I'm king <br>
            Things change when I'm with you <br>
            Baby, facing your smile, it's so disarming <br>
            <br>
            Pop up in my head (my head), dreaming of the day (of the day) <br>
            When you come and take me away like a princess <br>
            Don't fret, just be brave (be brave) <br>
            It's you and me, there ain't no other way <br>
            <br>
            Drop the beat, I feel <br>
            Like a roller coaster going up and down <br>
            Because (love is-, ooh) <br>
            I-I-I know I'm lost <br>
            My yearning heart was stolen by you (ooh) <br>
            Blu-blu-blu-blush, my spark <br>
            Like a blooming flower when I think of you <br>
            Because (love is-, ooh) <br>
            I-I-I know I'm lost <br>

            <br>
            Yeah, pull up, pull up, do up my hair <br>
            Yearning, yearning, being more than friends <br>
            Boy, don't play peekaboo-boo <br>
            Piggy little Bangboo's gonna lead my way to you <br>
            <br>
            Baby, since the last time we spoke <br>
            It's been so long (I miss you) <br>

            Do I seem like I'm not supposed to be <br>
            Written in a sugary and dreamy love story? <br>
            You are the one makes me wanna sing a love song, ooh, ha <br>
